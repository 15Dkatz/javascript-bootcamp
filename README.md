JavaScript is the most in-demand skill. Get an extra advantage with this course's special JS interview question videos.

In this course you will learn:
* the differences between function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
* when the `this` keyword is relevant.
* why and how almost everything is an object.
* a handful of ways to create object clones.
* constructor functions
* asynchronous code.
* a myriad of ways to write clean JavaScript code.
* intricacies of types - coercion, null vs. undefined, truthy, falsy, and more.
* the differences between let, const, and var.
* closures, function factories, and higher-order functions.
* prototypes and the prototype-based inheritance model.
* how to track code through the JavaScript runtime - through the callstack, heap, queue, and event loop.
